I decided to use python and Flask cause I am familiar with them

My experience using Flask : I implemented an application that uses twitter API to scrap data

For pure python : I tend to use it in most of my college projects for the past year

What I wanted to accomplish with my application:

- Connect clients using mqtt protocol
- let clients subscribe to topics
- let clients post messages
- Clients only recieve messages for the topics they subsribe to and they have to be connected before 
the message is being published

** at the end of my application some commented code for publish and subscribe that I haven't implemented their logic yet but the 
codes for publish and subscribe are their -they are pretty easy-

What I learned:
- The concept of IOT 
- What is a MQTT protocol : that it is a M2M machine to machine service , publish/subscribe messaging protocol
very useful for low bandwidth applications 
- How IOT really works and how machines really communicate
- How to document requirements in requirements.txt and why it is useful :

           pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
           
    
Thought process:
- Search about MQTT protocol and learn more about it what it does , why it is useful , and how it can be implemented in python
- Decide if the Framework I am going to use will be useful
- Know the requirements and install them
- Know which libraries will be the most useful
- Open the documentation for the library and see how to implement each function
- Implement one function at a time and test it functions well before going to the next

At first I didn't have any idea about IOT or MQTT then know I think they are so easy and good to work with
